# Frogger (Clone): The Buggening!

This is my take on the classic arcade game, Frogger.  In the game you'll control this guy.  
![Steve](images/char-boy.png)  
His name is **Steve**.  You'll use the **arrow keys**...

...to move Steve around the map, trying to get each level's **key**.

Once you have the key, you're going to want to head to what I'm calling a **door**.  Though it's really more of a rock I colored gold and gave a keyhole.  But close enough right?  Either way, when you get to the rock-door (and you have the key) you'll move up to the next level!

Try to get to the door as quickly as possible to score more points!  And for additional points try to get each level's **gem**!

But move quickly!  Gems will begin to fade and then disappear only a short time after the level begins.  

All along the way you're going to be avoiding these guys...

**...rampaging enemy bugs!**  

Oh, and don't go in the **water** either.  You don't know how to swim, Steve.

And keep in mind you can't move onto tiles with **rocks** on them.

There's no end to the game!  Just see how far you can get and how high you can keep your score!  As the levels progress the number of enemies will increase and different types of enemies will be introduced!

At any time you can press **P** to pause the game.  Press **Enter** or close the dialog box to resume play.  

And that's about it!  Use the **arrow keys** to move Steve and press **P** if you want to pause.

I hope you enjoy the game!!
